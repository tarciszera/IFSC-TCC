  abstract = {In this paper, a simple method to obtain the equivalent radiation emitting sources of an electronic circuit using the near-field scanning method is presented. The model is based on a set of elemental dipoles that substitutes the electronic circuit and radiates the same magnetic field. Two different approaches are presented: a set of electric dipoles and a set of magnetic dipoles. In order to build the model, both the magnitude and phase of the magnetic field are required. These measurements are carried out using the "near-field scanning method," and two procedures are presented: using the vector network analyzer and the spectrum analyzer. Finally, the model is applied to two different cases: to obtain the radiated near-field of a component (microcontroller) and to obtain the field of a complete electronic board.},

In response, Constantine Balanis has updated his classic text, Antenna Theory, offering the most recent look at all the necessary topics. New material includes smart antennas and fractal antennas, along with the latest applications in wireless communications. Multimedia material on an accompanying CD presents PowerPoint viewgraphs of lecture notes, interactive review questions, Java animations and applets, and MATLAB features. Like the previous editions, Antenna Theory, Third Edition meets the needs of electrical engineering and physics students at the senior undergraduate and beginning graduate levels, and those of practicing engineers as well. It is a benchmark text for mastering the latest theory in the subject, and for better understanding the technological applications. An Instructor's Manual presenting detailed solutions to all the problems in the book is available from the Wiley editorial department.},

We fabricated two types of magnetic near-field probe and evaluated frequency characteristics for magnetic and electric near-field in isolation. For the measurement results, we proposed accurate equivalent circuit of probes and evaluated each value of lumped parameter to study the difference of probes. Theoretical results accorded with measurement results. With the use of a fabricated probe, a measurement technique for the improvement of spatial resolution was proposed. This technique allows improving and easy modification of spatial resolution without redesign of probe},
